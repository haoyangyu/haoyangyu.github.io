    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>On August 22nd, 2013, through the plane flying from Beijing, China to Newark, America, I arrived at the country that I was dreaming since I was in high school. Everything is totally fresh to me, anyway I enjoy being a <em><strong>trailblazer</strong></em> to take adventure for my life.</p>
    <p>Currently, I am in my first semester as a graduate student at <a href="http://www.rutgers.edu">Rutgers, newbrunswick university</a> studying in the field of computer engineering. Computer Architecture, Software Engineering and Software/hardware Embedded System are the courses I am taking in this semester, fall 2013.</p>
    <p>Because when I was a undergraduate student in <a href="http://www.oice.uestc.edu.cn/en/">University of Electronic Science and Technology of China</a>(UESTC), I was not in the field of computer science, the subjects of my major are more focused on Electronic Engineering, however I studied a lot by myself. My friends and I were chosen to be team members representing UESTC to participate the <a href="http://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/">2013 MCM/ICM competition</a> and won <a href="2013MCMICM.pdf">the Honorable Mention Prize</a>, the <a href="2013MCMICMpaper.pdf">paper</a> is attached. Now, I hold the opinion that the strong foundation of EE and mathematics can contribute to my graduate years in CE. I enjoy all the challenges I faced and believe I can conquer them successfully.
    </p>
    <p>I am a sport aficionado. <a href="/images/jumpshoot.jpg">Basketball</a>, <a href="/images/tennis.jpg">tennis</a>, swimming, running, hiking and traveling are my favorite events. They make me energetic and healthy. I <em><strong>love</strong></em> life and <em><strong>cherish</strong></em> every moments of my life. Hoping I will have a wonderful and amazing life journey.</p>
